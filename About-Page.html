<h1>Melvin Peguero</h1>

  <p><b>Introduction;</b>
    I am a very friendly and sociable person who loves to have a good time when the time is right. Born in Puerto Rico, I've been living for nearly 13 years within my home town in San Juan, Villa Palmeras. Growing up, I spent the majority of my time playing video games with my father, and thanks to him, it piqued my interest towards technology and or video games. What I aim to give out to the world is the knowledge that there are good things out there. </p>

<p>“Be the reason why there’s goodness out there in the world” </p>

	<p>This second gif, I created yet another looping gif which Out of the other GIFs, this animation demonstatres one of the rules of animation which involves anticipation.</p>

	<img src="GIFs/3rdGIF.gif" alt="ShortAnimation">
	<p>I managed to create this GIF when I became more advanced at making animations and having a deeper understanding in using keyframes. A seamless and comical loop that demonstrates the scenarion of a robber and the colors of the police in the background. </p>
